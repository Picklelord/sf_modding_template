# Starfield Modding Project Structure
### This repo holds the base structure of my mod development folders and plans for mods

The aim of this is to provide anyone who wants to get into modding starfield with a good starting template with build tools.
It provides the ability to separate your ini mods into separate files, so you can copy a bunch of different .ini mod's, or make them unique, and it will compile them so that there aren't any double ups of commands etc.
It provides an environment for writing psc files and compiling them with efficiency.
There is a **"setup_venv.bat"** that runs through the ful setup process and installs the required apps and files needed, providing a fast setup and little research needed to get going on making mods.
I have setup a Build and Install tool to provide rapid modification and testing.
Take a look at the **"StepByStepInstructions.md"** for details on the setup process, the build process and install process.

Currently this is only setup for Windows.

I am in progress of writing a Papyrus Documentation Generator to provide an easier way of finding commands and scripts that will be useful etc.
